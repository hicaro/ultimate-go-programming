/*
Course material: `https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining`

The Advanced Ultimate Go class is designed to focus on digging deep into the language to understand the internals that matter and the semantics.
The course is about if performance matters then these things matter.
This is presented from focusing on code readability at a micro level to full application architecture and development.
